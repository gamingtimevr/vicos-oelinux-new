# wire-os

The main repo for WireOS.

WireOS serves as a nice, stable, and maintained base for Vector CFW.

## Submodules

- /poky/poky -> [yoctoproject/poky](https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky) (walnascar)
- /poky/meta-openembedded -> [openembedded/meta-openembedded](https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded) (walnascar)
- /anki/victor -> [wire-os-victor](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os-victor) (main)
- /anki/wired -> [wired](https://github.com/os-vector/wired) (main)

## Update notes:

- **05-21-2025**: you might want to run `./build/clean.sh "connman wpa-supplicant base-files systemd tzdata alsa-lib alsa-tools alsa-utils"` before building again

## Build

- Note: you will need a somewhat beefy **x86_64 Linux** machine with at least 16GB of RAM and 100GB of free space.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), git, and wget.

2. Configure it so a regular user can use it:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

3. Clone and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os --recurse-submodules
cd wire-os
./build/build.sh -bt <dev/oskr> -bp <boot-passwd> -v <build-increment>
# boot password not required for dev
# example: ./build/build.sh -bt dev -v 1
```

### Where is my OTA?

    -   Performances
        -   He will somewhat randomly do loosepixel and binaryeyes
    -   Better camera gamma correction
        -   He handles too-bright situations much better now

## What isn't there yet

- delta updates
- iptables
- r/o rootfs (due to time zone setting. Anki's /data/etc/localtime patch didn't work)
